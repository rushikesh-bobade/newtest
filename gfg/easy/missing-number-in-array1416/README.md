![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]** of size n - 1 containing distinct integers in the range [1, n]. The array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with exactly one element missing.

Find and return the missing element.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.

```

        int n = arr.size() + 1;

        long long total = (1LL * n * (n + 1)) / 2;

        for (int num : arr) {
            total -= num;
        }
